## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project investigates how **influencers**â€”highly connected nodes in a networkâ€”affect the *Majority Illusion*, especially when they hold a **minority opinion**.

> **Majority Illusion**: A phenomenon where a minority view appears dominant locally, distorting perception across the network.

The study uses simulated **BarabÃ¡siâ€“Albert (BA) networks**, which resemble real social networks, to test:

- **Three minority-to-majority ratios**:
  - 10% Red nodes (minority)
  - 30% Red nodes
  - 40% Red nodes
- **Two phases**:
  - *Static*: Before any opinions spread
  - *Dynamic*: After iterative opinion updates (majority threshold rule)

**200 simulations** were run per configuration.
